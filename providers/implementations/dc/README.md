## DC Algorithm Specification
- **Block size:** 128 bits (16 bytes)
- **Key size:** 128 bits (16 bytes)
- **Substitution (S-box):** A bijective function that maps 256 possible byte values to another unique 256 byte values.
- **Permutation (P-box):** A function that rearranges the 16 bytes of the block.

For educational purposes, the correctness of this cipher will rely on the invertibility of each step: the S-box has a corresponding inverse S-box, and the P-box has an inverse P-box. Let's go into details:

#### 1. Substitution Box (S-box)
The S-box is a fixed table used to perform a byte-wise substitution of the block. Each byte of the input is replaced by another byte according to the S-box. The S-box must be a bijection (one-to-one and onto), meaning each input byte maps to a unique output byte, ensuring that it is reversible.

Example S-box (simplified and not secure, for demonstration):
```plaintext
Input bytes:  00 01 02 03 ... FE FF
S-box output: 3A 7C 15 01 ... 5E 9F
```

#### 2. Permutation Box (P-box)
The P-box rearranges the bytes of the block. Like the S-box, it is also bijective, ensuring that each input position maps to a unique output position, and vice versa.

Example P-box:
```plaintext
Input positions:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15
P-box positions: 15 14 13 12 11 10  9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0
```

### Correctness Proof
The cipher is correct (i.e., decryptable) if every encryption step has a corresponding decryption step that reverses the effect. Given that both the S-box and P-box are bijective:
- The inverse S-box (IS-box) will reverse the substitution made by the S-box.
- The inverse P-box (IP-box) will reverse the permutation made by the P-box.

### Encrypt and Decrypt Operations
- **Encrypt:**
  1. Substitute using S-box.
  2. Permute using P-box.
- **Decrypt:**
  1. Permute using IP-box.
  2. Substitute using IS-box.

### Conclusion
For the DC algorithm to be cryptographically secure, which this simple example is not, you would need several rounds of substitution and permutation, possibly with different S-boxes and P-boxes for each round, along with a key schedule for generating round keys from the main key.

Implementing this in a secure fashion requires more advanced cryptographic design principles. However, for educational purposes, this basic structure helps understand how more complex and secure block ciphers like AES are constructed.
